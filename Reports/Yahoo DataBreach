Yahoo DataBreach

What type of attack was this?
Once again, this attack took place via a series of Spear-Phishing emails containing malware. One simple click from a single user gave them access to the database. They also created a backdooe to the yahoo server and kept coming back for more. The attack lasted over 3 years and the user accounts of 3 billion people were exposed. Amongst them, high profile users. 

How was the vulnerability discovered?
I was not able to find out how they discovered the vulnerability. The article just said that yahoo came forward saying they had a breach and over 500,000 accounts/users had been compromised. # months later they found another breach where the number grew to 1 billion and one the FBI got invovled, they discovered the breach was actually for 3 billion users. 

How were the attackers able to exploit the vulnerability?
They were able to get access to the network via  Phishing email. Then they made sure not to lose access to the database by creating a backdoor. 

Were there security measures that could have been taken in order to prevent this attack?
Yes, to have stronger security. Creating more awareness and training their staff on what to look for to prevent Phishing emails and etc. This was during 2013-2016. They should have done a better job to protect billions of customers.
